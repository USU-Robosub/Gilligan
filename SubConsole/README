Things you must do:
1. Setup ROS
2. Get Qt4 installed
3. Get joystick++ library built and installed
4. Set an environment variable called QT_ROOT to point to your Qt installation (QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc)
5. Put things project inside your ros workspace
6. Navigate to the SubConsole/build directory and run build.sh
7. Executable should build into SubConsole/

Make sure you have roscore running and that "should" be it.
