Things you must do (32-bit):
1. Setup ROS
2. Get Qt4 installed (grab it from Qt's website)
3. Copy all libraries in USUbConsole/libs to usr/lib
4. Set an environment variable called QT_ROOT to point to the Qt installation folder containing the bin directory (i.e. QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc)
5. Navigate to the USUbConsole/build directory and run build.sh
6. Executable should build into SubConsole/

Make sure you have roscore running and that "should" be it.

64-bit Notes:
-Make sure you installed the 64-bit version of Qt
-You will need to grab install the 64-bit libjoystick++ library from sourceforge
-You might need to download and build qwt, copying the built libraries into /usr/lib
